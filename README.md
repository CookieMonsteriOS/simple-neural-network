# Simple AI - Neural Network Training

## Overview
This project is a technical exercise demonstrating a simple neural network with forward and backward propagation. It is implemented in Python and trains on basic input data.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/simple_ai.git
   cd simple_ai
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the training script with:
```sh
python simple_ai.py
```

## Debugging
To debug in VS Code:
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Configure `launch.json` for debugging.
3. Set breakpoints and run the debugger.

## Technical Details
- Implements a simple neural network with:
  - Forward propagation
  - Backward propagation
  - Weight and bias updates using gradient descent
- Uses matrix-vector operations for calculations.

## Notes
This is a **technical exercise** designed for educational purposes and may not be optimized for production use.
